Created on 2020 February.
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features.
Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; also Lasso or LASSO) is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the resulting statistical model.
